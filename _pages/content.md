## Channels

PREGOâ€™s contents are mainly divided into three distinct channels of information based on data origin and format.
The Literature channel exploits scientific publications, i.e. abstracts and full text open access scientific publications using text mining tools.
Through the Annotated Genomes and Isolates channel, PREGO retrieves genome annotations and their accompanying metadata.
Finally, the Environmental Samples channel supports the integration of metagenomic analyses (from both amplicon and shotgun studies); taxonomic and functional profiles along with their corresponding metadata. 


## Statistics


### Entities

The entities of PREGO after the NER and mapping of every source. Counts of distinct entities of Taxa, Environments (ENVO terms), Biological Processes (Gene Ontology Biological process) and Molecular Function (Gene Ontology Molecular Function).
