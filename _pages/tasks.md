## Text mining
* extraction of  *process-environment-organism* associations buried in the scientific literature, free text descriptions of biological database records, and in dedicated community web pages
* development of a named entity recognition module to identify environmental process mentions in text
* association strength based on comention statistics

## Knowledge gathering and association extraction
* collection of *process-environment-organism* evidence from public data record metadata and computational analysis record annotations
* confidence score assignment to each annotation based on its evidence source

## Homology-based annotation transfer
* prediction (based on sequence homology) of related processes and environments for novel sequences and/or sequences with insufficient metadata
* sequence-based searches against the PREGO platform facilitation
* in-house sequence upload (along with their metadata) in the PREGO platform 

## Association unification
* unification of the calculated process-environment-organism associations
* design and implementation of an overall confidence score for the PREGO associations
* management and storing the unified associations in a database
* periodic update of the PREGO associations and liaison to emerging data infrastructures

## Association presentation
* PREGO associations: made accessible to researchers via a web platform
* facilitation of text and sequence searches against the PREGO process-environment-organism associations
* confidence and supporting evidence display for retrieved associations
* enrichment analysis and network-based assocation exploration
* programmatic access and bulk download options made available
