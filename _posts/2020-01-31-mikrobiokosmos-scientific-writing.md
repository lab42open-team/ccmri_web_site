In 31st of January Greek Scientific Society Microbiokosmos (MBK) organized a workshop entitled ["How to write a scientific paper: from writing to publishing"](http://www.mikrobiokosmos.org/en/blog/mbk-workshop-scientific-writing). The Workshop was held simultaneously in six different institutions across Greece. Two members of the PREGO project, Haris Zafeiropoulos and Savvas Paragkamian, joined the workshop in the Technical University of Crete in Chania which was coordinated by Associate Professor Dr. Danae Venieri. 

The Workshop included videos from the Virtual Seminar of the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) and was structured in three parts: 

* Introduction - Basics - Figures and Tables
* Text composition - Title and Abstract - Ethics
* Submission and Review - Response to decision - Other Scientic writing

During the Workshop fruitful discussions arose about the importance of writing and some common mistakes about the methology in writing. Equally important, the process of submission was analysed from the different perspectives of the authors, reviewers and editors in detail with specific examples.
