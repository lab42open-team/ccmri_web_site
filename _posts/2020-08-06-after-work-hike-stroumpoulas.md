Visitors always inspire some exploration! So this time we went to Stroumpoulas with our friend Miguel Desmarais, a ~800 meter peak 10km on the east side of Heraklion, for a quick hike after work (see [here](http://www.hellaspath.gr/index.php?p=2&m=1&mntid=60#607)). Only 15 minutes away from home we did a 2 hour hike from the Stoumpoulas plateau to the peak. All this area is part of the [Psiloreitis Geopark of Unesco](https://www.psiloritisgeopark.gr/el/fysiko-parko-psiloriti-pagkosmio-gewparko-unesco/) and a Natura 2000 area! It combines wild nature of maquis vegetation and limestone scenery with a nice view to Heraklion!
