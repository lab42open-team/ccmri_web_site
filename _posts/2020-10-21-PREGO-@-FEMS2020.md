This year **FEMS** is organizing an **[online conference](https://fems2020belgrade.com/)** due to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic.

**PREGO could not miss it!**

See you all in the [Environmental Session (Session 7)](https://fems2020belgrade.com/scientific-program/) for a short discussion. There we will discuss:

* how PREGO is extracting associations among microorganisms, biological processes and environment types
* how mining literature and -omics data and metadata wil combine all these associations
* how the web inteface is going to assist microbial ecologists in bringing all these data together as well as in hypothesis generation
