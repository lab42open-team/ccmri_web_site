PREGO welcomes two new members, Dr Lucia Fanini and Rania Theologi.
Lucia will be PREGO's postdoc and she will work across a variaty of aspects of PREGO, dissemination and curation along with social media handling.
She has been a longtime collaborator with the team in projects like [Species and Organisms text mining tools](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0065390), [ENVIRONMENTS and EOL](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv045) and many others.
Many fruitfull ideas are already taking shape regarding using PREGO's code base for literature mining in areas outside microbiology, albeit crucial for ecosystem functioning like beach ecology.

Rania is a master student and she will work on text mining.
More specificaly, her thesis is about **Chemical text and association rule mining to facilitate the study of metabolic processes in hyperthermophilic microorganisms** and is hosted by the Data Science and Information Technologies Master Program of the National Kapodistrian University of Athens.
Supervision of the thesis is a collaboration between [Dr Theodore Dalamangas](https://www.imsi.athenarc.gr/en/people/member/4) from [ATHENA research center](https://www.imsi.athenarc.gr) and [Dr Evangelos Pafilis](http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/people/evangelospafilis/) from [IMBBC - HCMR](http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/people/evangelospafilis/).
She will combine [PREGO](https://prego.hcmr.gr/Search)'s code base for corpus creation with the [spaCyi neural networks library](https://spacy.io) to create a novel Named Entity Recognition tagger to detect chemicals.

Welcome Lucia and Rania!!
