Lucia is seeking new challenges and will depart from Crete to work at Universit√† del Salento, Lecce, Italy.

During the past year Lucia contributed in many ways to PREGO, from social media handling to dissemination of original articles. 
In such short time a new paper emerged based on literature mining about beach ecology and macroplastics ( see [here the paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112951)).
In that article the team worked together to find gaps and trends in literature using text mining.
The findings confirmed the qualitative observation that Lucia had made; most of research on beach litter is focused on microplastics, thus neglecting macroplastics which are a major issue.
