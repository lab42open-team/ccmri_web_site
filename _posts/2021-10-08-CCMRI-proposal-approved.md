Climate Change Metagenomic Record Index (CCMRI): a dynamic researcher-notification and sample classification system is an upcoming project of [Dr Evangelos Pafilis](http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/people/evangelospafilis/) funded by [H.F.R.I.](https://www.elidek.gr/call/2i-prokiryxi-ereynitikon-ergon-el-id-e-k-gia-tin-enischysi-melon-dep-kai-ereyniton-trion/).

Building upon PREGO's knowledge base it will address major conteporary issues of knowledge discovery:
How many metagenomics datasets are related to climate change?
How to be up-to-date as new climate change related metagenomic records emerge?
How to categorize such records in useful subsets reflecting important aspects of climate change?

PREGO team is very excited for these news and looks forward to address these issues!
