Rania presents her thesis as a poster at the [9th Conference of Mikrobiokosmos](https://mikrobiokosmos2021.org). Her thesis **Chemical text and association rule mining to facilitate the study of metabolic processes in hyperthermophilic microorganisms** was hosted by the Data Science and Information Technologies Master Program of the National Kapodistrian University of Athens.
Supervision of the thesis was a collaboration between [Dr Theodore Dalamangas](https://www.imsi.athenarc.gr/en/people/member/4) from [ATHENA research center](https://www.imsi.athenarc.gr) and [Dr Evangelos Pafilis](http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/people/evangelospafilis/) from [IMBBC - HCMR](http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/people/evangelospafilis/).
She combined [PREGO](https://prego.hcmr.gr/Search)'s code base for corpus creation with the [spaCyi neural networks library](https://spacy.io) to create a novel Named Entity Recognition tagger to detect chemicals.
