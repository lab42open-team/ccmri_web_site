# Create new posts

The theme minimal/mistakes has a specific layout for blog posts. 

In our website all posts are created inside the _posts folder. Naming of each post must be consistent with this example: 
2020-01-21-sample-post.md

That is the case because the theme creates a new url with the name of the file and also for indexing inside the news tab.

Each post must have a yalm header with at least these variables

title: "Trip to France"
